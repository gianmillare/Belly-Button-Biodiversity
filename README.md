# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

This project combines Javascript, HMTL, and Flask to display interactive data on a web application. This also serves as a brief introduction to the Heroku App builder. In this application, a predetermined dataset on the characteristics of bacteria is displayed on screen. Users of the application will be able to view the data through various graphic methods. Pertaining more to aesthetic programming than algorithmic programming, this project delves deeper into advanced JavaScript and front-end development methods.
